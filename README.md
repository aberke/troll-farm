By trolls, for trolls.

Why
----
I want a pleasant space, isolated environment for trolls to roam freely, meet each other, and communicate.  They should have the opportunity to spawn and aspire to grow long beards.

I mean I wanted to learn Go and play with web sockets and make something interesting.
